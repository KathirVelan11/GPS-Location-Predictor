## 🎯 Problem Statement

Dementia affects millions worldwide, with **60% of patients experiencing wandering behavior**. By combining IoT hardware with machine learning, this system predicts patient locations in advance, enabling faster caregiver response and potentially saving lives.

## 💡 Solution Overview

Our system uses real-time GPS tracking and predictive analytics to:
- 📍 Continuously monitor patient location
- 🔮 Predict future movement patterns
- 🚨 Alert caregivers before patients get lost
- 📊 Provide insights into movement behaviors

## 🧪 How to Use

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPS-Location-Predictor.git
cd GPS-Location-Predictor

# 2. Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Steps to Run the Project
1. Upload your .csv GPS file (must follow [DATA_FORMAT.md]). 
2. Open and run `📄 Location prediction.ipynb` notebook.
   - It will handle **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **prediction** based on your input.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository contains all core files needed for end-to-end location prediction using GPS data:

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `📄 Location prediction.ipynb`| All-in-one notebook that performs data preprocessing, model training, and future location prediction |
| `📄 DATA_FORMAT.md`              | Defines the required format for the input GPS `.csv` file, including column order, valid formats, and sample data |
| `📄 ARCHITECTURE.md`             | Contains system architecture diagram and component-level explanation |
| `📄 ML_Models.md`                | Details machine learning models used, tuning strategies, evaluation metrics, and reasoning |
| `📄 README.md`                   | Main project documentation with setup steps, usage guide, and future work suggestions |
| `📂 Hardware/GPS_data_logging.ino`   | Arduino code to collect GPS data and log it as a `.csv` file to the SD card |

## 📟 Arduino GPS Logger

This hardware module collects real-time GPS coordinates and logs them into a `.csv` file using an Arduino and GPS setup. The logged file (`data.csv`) is later used for location prediction.

### 🔌 Components Used
- 🛰️ **Neo 6M GPS Module** – for fetching real-time latitude and longitude
- 💡 **Arduino Uno** – microcontroller to interface with GPS and SD modules
- 💾 **SD Card (any storage size)** – for storing the location data
- 📦 **SD Card Module** – interfaces the SD card with Arduino
- 🔌 **Jumper Wires** – for circuit connections
- 🔋 **Power Bank** – portable power supply for Arduino

### 📁 File
- `Hardware/GPS_data_logging.ino` – Arduino script that:
  - Reads GPS data using SoftwareSerial
  - Extracts latitude, longitude, and IST-adjusted date & time
  - Writes each record into the SD card in `.csv` format (`data.csv`)

> ✅ The `.csv` file generated by this Arduino code already follows the structure defined in [`DATA_FORMAT.md`](DATA_FORMAT.md). You can directly upload it into the Python pipeline for prediction.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

See detailed explanation of the models used, their tuning strategies, evaluation metrics, and reasons for selection in [ML_Models.md](ML_Models.md).

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add a real-time alert system using GSM module or mobile app. 
- Deploy model on microcontroller to make it edge-capable (without laptop/Colab).
- Improve prediction accuracy using deep learning or sequence models (LSTM).
- Add interactive map visualization using `Folium` or `Mapbox` for path tracking.
